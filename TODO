	*introduction to PMBLDC
		** components in PMBLDC
		** how it works
		** ac signal
	*introduction to shell eco marathon (Problem Statement)
		** how it works, rules, distance, spec
	*objectives
		** tapping the signal from the proprietary system
		** develop the apparatus for measuring the motor performance
		** propose a method for improving the efficiency through reducing the cogging torque? by altering the hall effect sensor signal
		** improving the mileage of the electric vehicle by tuning Cd
	*scope of research
		** the power output and torque curve of the electric motor
		** investigate the composition signal/pin of the PMBLDC
		** study the track profile of the Sepang International North Track 
		** compose a set of strategy for enhancing the mileage
		** changes to the Cd, how and why? Retest, get the data for mileage improvement investigation
